"""
Minimal MCP client stub for the organic virtual pet.

This module provides a lightweight standâ€‘in for a real Model Context Protocol
client, inspired by the AskIt library. It loads an `mcp_config.json` file
located alongside the code and dispatches method calls to the appropriate
local components (e.g. `PetState` or `MemoryStore`) based on the server
configuration. In a production environment you would replace this stub
with a full MCP client that communicates with remote servers over HTTP or
other transports.
