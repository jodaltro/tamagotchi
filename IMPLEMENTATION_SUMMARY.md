## Project: Tamagotchi Virtual Pet Enhancements

### Completed: 2025-10-26

---

## Requirements (from Problem Statement)

The user requested the following enhancements in Portuguese:

1. **Better Memory** - Improve the pet's ability to remember things using AI to structure relevant information
2. **Reinforcement Learning** - Pet can forget but relearn through repetition
3. **AI-Driven Importance** - Use AI to identify what's important to store
4. **Triple Drive Count** - Expand from 6 to ~18 drives including negative ones (with caution)
5. **Enhanced Image Memory** - Store important information from images (people, animals, characteristics)

---

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ 1. Expanded Drive System (6 → 18 drives)

**Neuroscience Research Base:**
- Reiss's 16 Basic Desires
- Drive Theory (Hull, Freud)
- Panksepp's Affective Neuroscience Systems

**18 Drives Implemented:**

**Positive (12):**
- curiosity, affection, order, sociability, autonomy, humor
- achievement, power, acceptance, idealism, tranquility, creativity

**Neutral (2):**
- hunger, rest

**Negative (4) - with safeguards:**
- anxiety, frustration, loneliness, boredom
- Start low (0.1-0.3 instead of 0.3-0.7)
- Increase slowly over time without interaction
- Capped at 0.6 to prevent extremes
- Reduced by positive interactions

**Drive Dynamics:**
- Positive drives decay toward equilibrium (0.5)
- Negative drives increase without interaction
- Personality traits modulate all decay rates
- Content-aware updates (e.g., "consegui" increases achievement)

### ✅ 2. AI-Driven Memory Importance

**Module:** `ai_memory_analyzer.py`

**Conversation Analysis:**
```python
importance, facts = analyze_conversation_importance(text, existing_facts)
# Returns:
# - importance: 0.0-1.0 score
# - facts: List of extracted structured facts
```

**Importance Levels:**
- 0.9-1.0: Critical personal info (name, age, family, health)
- 0.7-0.9: Important (work, hobbies, preferences)
- 0.5-0.7: Moderate (opinions, experiences)
- 0.3-0.5: Casual conversation
- 0.0-0.3: Trivial messages

**Implementation:**
- Uses Gemini API for analysis
- Falls back to heuristics without API
- Automatic fact extraction in "category: value" format

### ✅ 3. Memory Reinforcement Learning

**Key Features:**
- Memories stored with (weight, timestamp, access_count)
- Repetition increases weight and access count
- Frequently accessed memories resist decay
- Natural forgetting for unused information

**Example:**
```python
# First mention: "nome: João" → weight=0.9, count=1
# Reinforcement: "Sim, sou o João" → weight=1.0, count=2
# Result: Stronger memory, better retention
```

**Decay Mechanism:**
- Applied automatically every 24 hours
- Factors: time since access, access frequency
- Memories with weight < 0.1 are forgotten
- Popular memories decay slower (access_count factor)

### ✅ 4. Enhanced Image Memory

**AI Image Analysis:**
```python
analyze_image_memory(image_bytes, user_message, facts, context)
# Returns:
# - description: Detailed AI description
# - entities: {type: characteristics}
# - importance: 0.0-1.0
# - labels: [keywords]
```

**Entity Detection:**

**For People:**
- Who they are (infer from context)
- Appearance (hair, clothes, age)
- Style and characteristics

**For Animals:**
- Species and breed
- Physical characteristics (color, size)
- Owner inference
- Name detection

**For Objects/Places:**
- What they are
- Relevance to user

**Image Memory Structure:**
```python
class ImageMemory:
    features: List[float]           # For similarity matching
    labels: List[str]               # Simple keywords
    timestamp: datetime             # When sent
    ai_description: str             # Detailed description
    detected_entities: Dict         # Entity characteristics
    context: str                    # Conversation context
    importance_score: float         # AI-determined importance
```

**Cross-Referencing:**
- Links to conversation when image was sent
- References previous image memories
- Stores semantic facts about image content

## Example Usage

### Drive System
```python
from tamagotchi.virtual_pet import VirtualPet

pet = VirtualPet()

# Check drives (now 18 total)
print(pet.state.drives['achievement'])  # New positive drive
print(pet.state.drives['anxiety'])      # New negative drive

# Interaction affects drives
pet.user_message("Consegui terminar o projeto!")
# achievement ↑, frustration ↓

# Time passes without interaction
pet.state.tick(minutes=120)
# anxiety ↑, loneliness ↑
```

### AI Memory
```python
# User shares personal info
pet.user_message("Meu nome é Ana e trabalho como designer")

# AI analyzes:
# - importance: 0.9
# - facts: ["nome: Ana", "profissão: designer"]

# Later, user mentions again
pet.user_message("Sim, sou designer mesmo")

# Memory reinforced (weight increases, access_count++)
```

### Image Memory
```python
# User sends pet photo
with open("my_cat.jpg", "rb") as f:
    image = f.read()

pet.user_message("Este é meu gato, o Miau")
pet.user_image(image)

# AI analyzes:
# - description: "Gato laranja de pelo curto, jovem"
# - entities: {"animal": "gato, laranja, jovem, dono: usuário, nome: Miau"}
# - importance: 0.9

# Stores semantic fact: "tem pet: gato laranja chamado Miau"

# Later recognition
pet.user_image(another_cat_photo)
# Response: "Ah, é o Miau de novo? Ele cresceu!"
```
